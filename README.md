Project Title: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Project Description:
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By categorizing customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, businesses can personalize their marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer experience. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and important details for contributors.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (for running the project interactively)
Project Structure:
data/: Contains the dataset used for customer segmentation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing and clustering.
results/: Output files, visualizations, and cluster analysis results.
How to Run the Project:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/haseenabegum05/Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering.git
Navigate to the project directory:
arduino
Copy code
cd Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
Install the required packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory sequentially to understand the data and the clustering process.
Running the Python Scripts:
To run the clustering script, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/clustering.py
Make sure to update the script with the appropriate file paths and settings before running.

Important Note:
Ensure that the dataset is placed in the data/ directory with the filename customer_data.csv (or update the script/notebooks accordingly if the filename or location is different).
Customize the number of clusters (K) and other hyperparameters in the clustering script for optimal results.
